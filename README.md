# Discovering-Machine-Learning
Git repository to understand the basis of Machine Learning.

Terms like ML are developt in the different notebooks. The idea of this git repository is to provide a simple overview of what ML looks like and what are some simple strategy we can use to create, use and upgrade predictiv models.

The notebook are numbered to follow a way of thoughts, this is the most classical path to create ML algorithms but feel free to discover it by your own way to better understand all the concepts.

The notebook 0 is call the EDA (Early Data Analysis), it is essentially constitute by statistics, graphs and text that describe the data we will work with. The dataset we are going to study is the $\it{"Real\ Estate\ Dataset.csv"}$ from Kaggle, available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arnoldkakas/real-estate-dataset?resource=download, which describe the price of appartements in \$ using a lot of characteristics.
