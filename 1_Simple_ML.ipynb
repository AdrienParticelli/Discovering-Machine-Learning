    "Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on building systems that can learn from and make decisions based on data. In ML, algorithms are trained on large sets of data to recognize patterns and relationships. This training enables the algorithms to make predictions or take actions when they encounter new data.\n",
    "There are different types of ML, and each one has its particularity. In this notebook we will focus on Supervised and Unsupervised Learning : \n",
